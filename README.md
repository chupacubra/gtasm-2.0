# gTASM 2.0

This is a modification for the [gTerminal](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=109810455) addon, which adds the ability of the computer to run programs in the gTASM language. This makes it possible to **create** games or software and **share** scripts using diskettes.

Now the addon is still in development, but it is already capable of a lot.

What gTASM adds to the computer:
+ Personal OS with gTASM pack
+ Ð¡ode editor
+ Disk Management

#### What's new in 2.0?
+ Complete recycling of old verson
+ Program memory
+ Similarity of system interrupts
+ Cool editor with the ability to save code
